<h1>The Irish Immigrant Community in New York City</h1>

<p>By Sean Devlin and James Wasserman</p>

<h2>Pitch</h2>

<p>The Irish community in New York City has long been an influential one.  With dozens of mayors, police commissioners, lawmakers and countless other difference makers coming from Ireland or from immigrant families, the legacy of the Irish in New York is firmly cemented in history.  However, New York City remains one of the few places where Irish immigration remains strong, with thousands of Irish crossing the ocean every year in search of work, education, or an overall better life.  In fact, in not one, but two boroughs of New York City, there are specific immigration centers for Irish migrants (the Emerald Isle Immigration Center) that strive to help those who come to the United States find work, schooling, and provide cultural education to keep Irish culture alive in New York.</p>

<p>Who Cares: The larger Irish American community in New York City.</p>

<p>Why They Care Now: With the downturning Irish economy, Irish immigration could be on the rise once again, particularly to New York where the community is already robust.</p>

<p>We propose looking at the following facets of  immigrant life to figure out patterns of Irish life in America.  As a white, primarily English speaking group, the Irish are not generally seen as "foreign" in the traditional sense, especially given the fact that 16% of all Americans have some Irish ancestry.  These facets include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Total number of Irish immigrants to New York City since 2010</p></li>
<li><p>Irish Immigrant population by borough</p></li>
<li><p>Education level for Irish immigrants</p></li>
<li><p>Occupations for Irish immigrants</p></li>
<li><p>Average length of stay for Irish immigrants</p></li>
<li><p>Plans to return to Ireland (Y/N...propose a survey)</p></li>
<li><p>Irish language usage at home (this is sometimes used as a way for Irish people, particularly those from the more rural areas of the country, to communicate amongst themselves)</p></li>
<li><p>Immigration status of Irish in New York</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With the following methods, we will attempt to construct a more accurate picture of the modern Irish immigrant in New York as opposed to the romanticized portrayal of Irish American experiences that have arisen over the past 150 years.</p>
